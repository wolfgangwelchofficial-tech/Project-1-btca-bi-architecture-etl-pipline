# Executive KPI Impact Simulation

## Objective

Demonstrate how governed KPI standardization improves executive decision-making speed, clarity, and revenue performance.

---

## Baseline Problem (Pre-Governance)

Prior to KPI standardization:

- Revenue definitions varied across teams
- Product mix % calculated differently in dashboards
- Weekly executive reviews spent 30–45 minutes validating numbers
- Strategic pivots were delayed due to metric inconsistency

Estimated decision latency: 1–2 weeks per major adjustment.

---

## Post-Governance Impact

With standardized SQL views and governed metric definitions:

- One definition per KPI
- One executive reporting source
- Reduced reconciliation time
- Faster weekly decision cadence

Executive review time reduced from:
45 minutes → 15 minutes

Decision cycle reduced from:
Bi-weekly → Weekly

---

## Revenue Impact Modeling

Assume weekly revenue baseline:
$40,000

If faster detection enables 2% performance improvement per week:

40,000 × 1.02 = 40,800

Incremental weekly gain:
$800

Over 52 weeks:
$41,600 incremental revenue

---

## Operational Leverage

Governed architecture enables:

- Faster anomaly detection
- Faster SKU mix adjustments
- Faster labor alignment
- Reduced reporting disputes

The financial value of decision velocity often exceeds the cost of system implementation.

## Multi-Location Scaling Effect

If deployed across 10 locations:

$41,600 × 10 = $416,000 annual revenue leverage

This demonstrates how architecture-level improvements produce enterprise-scale impact.
